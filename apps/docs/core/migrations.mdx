Migrations enable you to manage the changes in your

via code. You can create, update, and delete resources like products, prices, 
and plans using migrations.

## Installation

To start using migrations, install Fluire CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @fluire/cli -g
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add @fluire/cli
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @fluire/cli -g
```

```bash bun
bun add @fluire/cli -g
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

To configure Fluire CLI, create a new `fluire.config.ts` in the root of your
project and add pass your `Fluire` instance to the `defineConfig` function.

```typescript
// fluire.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'fluire/config'
import { fluire } from './lib/fluire'

export default defineConfig({
  fluire,
})
```

## Stripe

You can enable Stripe migrations by passing the `stripe` property to the
`defineConfig` function with some configuration options.

- `webhooks`: The glob pattern of your webhooks files.
- `products`: The glob pattern of your products files.
- `features`: The glob pattern of your features files.

```typescript
// fluire.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'fluire/config'
import { fluire } from './lib/fluire'

export default defineConfig({
  fluire,
  stripe: {
    webhooks: 'lib/webhooks/*.ts',
    products: 'lib/products/*.ts',
    features: 'lib/features/*.ts',
  },
})
```

Running the migration command will create the resources in the Stripe API.

```bash
fluire migrate stripe
```

### Destructive

To delete the resources and create again, you can use the `--destructive` flag.

```bash
fluire migrate stripe --destructive
```

<Warning>
Be careful when using the `--destructive` flag, as it will delete all the 
previous resources in the Stripe API.
</Warning>

### Webhooks 

When you create webhooks, the CLI will reply the secrets to you, so you can use 
them in your application.

```bash
fluire migrate stripe

# Webhook created successfully! Secret: whsec_**************
```

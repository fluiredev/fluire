title: Installation
---

To install Fluire in your application, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- A [Stripe Account](https://stripe.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) or any other JavaScript runtime compatible with Stripe SDK
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or any other package manager compatible with Node.js (or your runtime)

## Installation

To install Fluire in your application, open your terminal and run the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i fluire
```

```bash yarn
yarn add fluire
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add fluire
```

```bash bun
bun add fluire
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

To configure Fluire in your application, you need to provide a Stripe secret key. If you don't know how to find your key, you can follow the [official documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys).

Save your Stripe secret key in a secure location and never expose it in your client-side code.

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_**************
```

## Usage

Now, you can import Fluire in your application and start using it.

```typescript
// lib/fluire.ts
import { Fluire } from 'fluire'

const fluire = new Fluire({
  stripe: {
    secretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  }
})
```

Features are a Stripe resource to represent the items, services or functionalities that you provide in your products. 
You can create features and link them to your revenue model.

## Creating a feature

To create a new feature, import your `Fluire` instance and create a new instance of the `Feature` class.

```typescript	
// lib/features.ts
import { fluire } from './fluire'

const accessApiFeature = new fluire.stripe.Feature({
  name: 'Access to the REST API',
  key: 'access-api'
})
```

Fluire provides a type-safe way to handle webhooks from Stripe. To use webhooks in your application, you need to create a new instance of the `Webhook` class and pass the Stripe webhook secret key.

Be sure you already have a Fluire instance in your application. If you don't have one, you can follow the [installation guide](/installation).

```typescript
// lib/webhooks.ts
import { fluire } from './fluire'

export const webhook = new fluire.stripe.Webhook({
  events: ['invoice.*', 'checkout.*'],
  secret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
  handle: async ({ event, payload, stripe }) => {
    console.log('Received event:', event)

    if (event === 'invoice.paid') {
      // Payload is a Stripe.InvoicePaidEvent.Data
    }
  }
})
```

Now you need to create a new endpoint in your application to receive the webhook events. You can use any web framework you want, but for this example, we'll use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

```typescript
// app/api/webhook/route.ts
import { webhook } from '@/lib/webhooks'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // You need to pass the request body and the 
  // Stripe-Signature header so Stripe can validate the request
  const body = await request.text()
  const signature = request.headers.get('Stripe-Signature')

  try {
    await webhook.handle({ body, signature })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
    return new Response('Error', { status: 400 })
  }

  return new Response('OK')
}
```
